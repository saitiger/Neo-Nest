# Technology Stack

## Development Approach
- **Platform Strategy**: Hybrid Mobile App (React Native/Flutter) for cross-platform MVP
- **Current Phase**: User research validation via web prototype
- **Architecture**: Mobile-first with modular REST/GraphQL APIs
- **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase for iOS and Android deployment

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-2s response times, 99.9% uptime target
- **Security**: Encryption at rest/transit, HIPAA/GDPR compliance
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based backend with CDN for media delivery

## Infrastructure
- **Backend**: Scalable cloud services
- **Database**: Encrypted storage with role-based access control
- **APIs**: Modular design for profiles, milestones, content, community
- **Integrations**: Maps API, telehealth platforms (premium features)

## Development Phases
1. **User Research (2-4 weeks)**: Web prototype validation
2. **Hybrid MVP (6-10 weeks)**: Cross-platform app with core functionality
3. **V1 (4-6 weeks)**: Expert sessions, enhanced tracker
4. **V2/V3 (6-8 weeks)**: Telehealth integration, premium features

## Hybrid Mobile Development Requirements
- **Framework**: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development
- **IDE**: VS Code with platform extensions, or platform-specific IDEs
- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript (React Native) or Dart (Flutter)
- **Deployment**: iOS App Store and Google Play Store
- **Testing**: Jest/Detox (React Native) or Flutter test framework

## Common Commands
*Note: Hybrid mobile build/test commands will be added as development progresses*

### React Native (if chosen)
```bash
npx react-native init NeoNest
npm run android
npm run ios
```

### Flutter (if chosen)
```bash
flutter create neo_nest
flutter run
flutter build apk
flutter build ios
```

## Compliance Considerations
- Liability disclaimers required
- Clinician sign-offs for medical content
- Legal review for healthcare regulations
- Privacy-by-design implementation
- App Store and Google Play review guidelines compliance
- Cross-platform security and data protection standards
