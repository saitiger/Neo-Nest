# Technology Stack

## Development Approach
- **Platform Strategy**: Hybrid mobile development (React Native/Flutter) for MVP
- **Architecture**: Mobile-first with modular REST/GraphQL APIs
- **Future Migration**: Native iOS/Android refinements for performance-critical flows

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-2s response times, 99.9% uptime target
- **Security**: Encryption at rest/transit, HIPAA/GDPR compliance
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based backend with CDN for media delivery

## Infrastructure
- **Backend**: Scalable cloud services
- **Database**: Encrypted storage with role-based access control
- **APIs**: Modular design for profiles, milestones, content, community
- **Integrations**: Maps API, telehealth platforms (premium features)

## Development Phases
1. **MVP (4-8 weeks)**: Core functionality with basic features
2. **V1 (4-6 weeks)**: Expert sessions, enhanced tracker
3. **V2/V3 (6-8 weeks)**: Telehealth integration, premium features

## Common Commands
*Note: Specific build/test commands will be added as the technical implementation progresses*

## Compliance Considerations
- Liability disclaimers required
- Clinician sign-offs for medical content
- Legal review for healthcare regulations
- Privacy-by-design implementation
