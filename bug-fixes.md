## Bug Fix #1 - December 14, 2024

### Bug Encountered
**Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: window is not defined`
**Location**: Line 120 in `MVP/script.js`
**Context**: Attempting to run a browser-specific JavaScript file directly with Node.js using the command `node.exe --experimental-network-inspection .\MVP\script.js`

### Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs because the JavaScript file (`script.js`) is designed to run in a browser environment where the `window` object is available as part of the DOM API. When executed directly with Node.js, the `window` object doesn't exist, causing a ReferenceError.

Specifically, the problematic code is:
```javascript
window.onclick = function(event) {
    // Modal closing logic
}
```

And:
```javascript
window.exportNeoNestData = exportResearchData;
```

Node.js provides a different runtime environment without browser-specific objects like `window`, `document`, `localStorage`, etc.

### How It Was Fixed
The issue is resolved by understanding that this JavaScript file should be loaded in a browser context via an HTML page, not executed directly with Node.js.

**Solution**: Open the `MVP/index.html` file in a web browser instead of running the script directly with Node.js.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the MVP directory
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (double-click the file or use a local server)
3. The JavaScript will execute properly in the browser environment

### Reasoning for This Fix
**Why this approach over alternatives**:

1. **Preserve Original Design**: The script is correctly written for browser execution and doesn't need modification
2. **Maintain Functionality**: All DOM interactions, localStorage, and window events work as intended in browser
3. **No Code Changes Required**: The issue is environmental, not a code bug
4. **Alternative Considered**: Could modify the script to check for Node.js environment and mock browser objects, but this would complicate the code unnecessarily for a browser-intended application

**Alternative Options Considered**:
- Wrap browser-specific code in environment checks (`if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`)
- Use a tool like jsdom to simulate browser environment in Node.js
- Refactor to separate Node.js compatible and browser-specific code

**Selected Solution Reasoning**: The simplest and most appropriate fix is to run the code in its intended environment (browser) rather than modify working code to accommodate an incorrect execution context.
