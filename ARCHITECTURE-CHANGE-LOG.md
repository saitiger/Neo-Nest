# Architecture Change Log

## December 14, 2024 - Hybrid Mobile Approach

### Change Summary
**From**: iOS Native App (Swift/SwiftUI)  
**To**: Hybrid Mobile App (React Native/Flutter)

### Rationale
- **Cross-platform reach**: Target both iOS and Android users simultaneously
- **Development efficiency**: Single codebase for faster iteration
- **Resource optimization**: Lean team can deliver to broader market
- **Market validation**: Faster time-to-market for user feedback

### Updated Documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated development approach and project description
- ✅ `MOBILE-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` - Renamed from iOS-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md with hybrid approach
- ✅ `Helper-Elements/PRD-v1.md` - Updated technical requirements
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/tech.md` - Updated technology stack and development requirements
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/development.md` - Updated architecture principles and testing
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Updated file references and development notes

### Technology Stack Decision
**Recommended**: React Native or Flutter
- React Native: JavaScript/TypeScript, mature ecosystem, strong community
- Flutter: Dart, excellent performance, Google backing

### Next Steps
1. Complete user research validation with web prototype
2. Choose between React Native and Flutter based on team expertise
3. Set up development environment for chosen framework
4. Begin hybrid mobile MVP development

### Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Broader market reach, faster development, cost efficiency
- **Considerations**: Platform-specific optimizations may require additional work
- **Mitigation**: Start with hybrid MVP, optimize platform-specific features in later versions

This architectural change aligns with the lean startup methodology and maximizes market validation opportunities.
