# Architecture Change Log

## December 14, 2024 - Hybrid Mobile Approach

### Change Summary
**From**: iOS Native App (Swift/SwiftUI)  
**To**: Hybrid Mobile App (React Native/Flutter)

### Rationale
- **Cross-platform reach**: Target both iOS and Android users simultaneously
- **Development efficiency**: Single codebase for faster iteration
- **Resource optimization**: Lean team can deliver to broader market
- **Market validation**: Faster time-to-market for user feedback

### Updated Documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated development approach and project description
- ✅ `MOBILE-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` - Renamed from iOS-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md with hybrid approach
- ✅ `Helper-Elements/PRD-v1.md` - Updated technical requirements
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/tech.md` - Updated technology stack and development requirements
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/development.md` - Updated architecture principles and testing
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Updated file references and development notes

### Technology Stack Decision
**Recommended**: React Native or Flutter
- React Native: JavaScript/TypeScript, mature ecosystem, strong community
- Flutter: Dart, excellent performance, Google backing

### Next Steps
1. Complete user research validation with web prototype
2. Choose between React Native and Flutter based on team expertise
3. Set up development environment for chosen framework
4. Begin hybrid mobile MVP development

### Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Broader market reach, faster development, cost efficiency
- **Considerations**: Platform-specific optimizations may require additional work
- **Mitigation**: Start with hybrid MVP, optimize platform-specific features in later versions

This architectural change aligns with the lean startup methodology and maximizes market validation opportunities.

## December 14, 2024 - Formal Requirements Specification

### Change Summary
**Added**: Formal requirements document with detailed user stories and acceptance criteria

### Details

- Each requirement includes user story and detailed acceptance criteria
- Covers all major features: baby profiles, milestone tracking, content library, community, play library, provider directory, security, and cross-platform experience
- Provides formal specification for development team and stakeholders

### Updated Documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Added reference to formal requirements
- ✅ `Helper-Elements/README.md` - Updated completed documentation list
- ✅ `DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md` - Added requirements reference
- ✅ `MVP/README.md` - Connected user research to formal requirements
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Updated project structure and documentation standards
- ✅ `MOBILE-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` - Added requirements validation to research goals

### Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Clear development specifications, stakeholder alignment, comprehensive acceptance criteria
- **Development**: Provides detailed guidance for hybrid mobile app implementation
- **Quality**: Enables proper testing and validation against defined criteria
