# Neo-Nest Mobile App

A React Native app for parents of preterm babies, providing corrected age tracking, milestone monitoring, and expert guidance.

## Project Status

**Phase**: Core Foundation Complete ‚úÖ  
**Current**: Corrected age utilities and milestone tracking fully implemented  
**Next**: User authentication and baby profile management

### Latest Updates
- ‚úÖ Corrected age calculation engine with comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ Preterm-specific milestone data structure and categories  
- ‚úÖ Interactive milestone tracking with status updates
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform responsive design for iOS and Android
- ‚úÖ TypeScript integration with full type safety

## Features Implemented

### üè† Home Screen
- **Baby Profile Display**: Shows baby's name and corrected age
- **Corrected Age Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays corrected age based on birth date and due date
- **Milestone Progress**: Visual progress bar showing completed milestones
- **Quick Actions**: Easy navigation to key features
- **Recent Activity**: Activity feed for user engagement

### üìä Milestone Tracker
- **Corrected Age-Based Milestones**: Displays milestones relevant to baby's corrected age
- **Category Filtering**: Filter milestones by developmental categories (Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Communication, Cognitive, Social-Emotional)
- **Progress Overview**: Visual progress indicators for each milestone category
- **Interactive Milestone Logging**: Tap milestones to update status (Not Started, In Progress, Achieved, Needs Attention)
- **Status Tracking**: Color-coded status indicators with achievement dates

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Corrected Age Calculations**: Accurate preterm age calculations using birth date and due date
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design optimized for various screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper accessibility labels and touch targets

### Data Models
- `BabyProfile`: Complete baby information including milestones
- `Milestone`: Individual milestone tracking with categories and status
- `MilestoneCategory`: Developmental categories with age ranges

### Key Components
- `HomeScreen`: Main dashboard with baby info and quick actions
- `MilestonesScreen`: Comprehensive milestone tracking interface
- `correctedAge.ts`: Utility functions for age calculations
- Sample milestone data with preterm-specific developmental ranges

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- React Native development environment
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator

### Installation
```bash
cd neo-nest-app
npm install

# For iOS
npx react-native run-ios

npm run typecheck
```

## Sample Data

The app includes sample data for demonstration:
- **Baby Profile**: Emma, born 6 weeks premature
- **Milestones**: Age-appropriate developmental milestones across 5 categories
- **Progress Tracking**: Interactive milestone status updates

## Next Steps

Based on the spec requirements, the following features are planned:
1. User authentication and profile management
2. Content library with doctor-backed articles
3. Community forum with moderation
4. Interactive play library
5. Healthcare provider directory
6. Push notifications and offline support

## Architecture

The app follows React Native best practices:
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Utility functions for business logic
- Modular data structures
- Responsive design patterns

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Neo-Nest MVP, focusing on the core value proposition of corrected age tracking and milestone monitoring for preterm babies.
