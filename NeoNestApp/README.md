## Key Features

### Corrected Age Calculation
- Accounts for preterm birth in development tracking
- Automatically adjusts milestone expectations
- Used until 24 months corrected age

### Milestone Tracking
- Preterm-specific developmental milestones
- Categories: Motor, Cognitive, Social, Language
- Clinical notes and delay indicators
- Age-appropriate filtering

### Cross-Platform Design
- Consistent UI across iOS and Android
- Accessibility-compliant components
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Development Notes

### Corrected Age Logic
The app uses corrected age for preterm babies:
- **Corrected Age** = Chronological Age - (Due Date - Birth Date)
- Used for milestone tracking until 24 months
- Helps set appropriate developmental expectations

### Milestone Categories
- **Motor Skills**: Physical development milestones
- **Cognitive**: Learning and thinking skills
- **Social & Emotional**: Interaction and emotional development
- **Language**: Communication and speech development

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for corrected age calculations
- Integration tests for milestone filtering
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Cross-platform testing on iOS/Android

## Next Development Steps

1. **Content Management System** - Doctor-backed articles and content library
2. **Community Features** - Moderated parent support groups and forums
3. **Provider Directory** - Healthcare provider listings and search
4. **Interactive Play Library** - Age-appropriate activities and games
5. **Push Notifications** - Milestone reminders and community updates
