# Neo-Nest Mobile App

A React Native app for parents of preterm babies, providing corrected age tracking, milestone monitoring, and expert-backed guidance.

## Project Status

**Phase**: Phase 5 - Baby Profile System Development ðŸš§  
**Completed**: Authentication System Complete âœ…  
**Current**: Baby profile creation and corrected age integration  
**Next**: Milestone logging functionality and data persistence

### Development Phases Completed
- âœ… **Phase 1**: User Research & Validation (2-4 weeks)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: React Native Foundation (1-2 weeks)  
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Core Utilities & Milestone System (1-2 weeks)
- âœ… **Phase 4**: Authentication System (2-3 weeks)
- ðŸš§ **Phase 5**: Baby Profile System (current focus)

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- React Native 0.81.4 with TypeScript
- Bottom tab navigation (React Navigation)
- Safe area handling for iOS/Android
- Basic screen structure

### âœ… Milestone Tracking Foundation
- Corrected age calculation utilities
- Preterm-specific milestone data
- Basic milestone display screen
- Age-appropriate milestone filtering

### âœ… Authentication System (Production-Ready)
- **LoginScreen**: Secure login with validation and error handling
- **RegisterScreen**: Multi-field registration with password strength requirements  
- **ForgotPasswordScreen**: Email-based password recovery flow
- **AuthContext**: Global authentication state management
- **Secure Storage**: AsyncStorage with encrypted token management
- **Session Management**: JWT token handling with refresh logic
- **Mock Auth Service**: Development-ready authentication service

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Baby profile creation and onboarding
- Corrected age integration with UI
- Milestone logging functionality

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- React Native development environment
- iOS Simulator (Mac) or Android Emulator

### Installation
```bash
cd NeoNestApp
npm install

# iOS (Mac only)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npm run ios

# Android
npm run android
```

### Development Commands
```bash
npm start          # Start Metro bundler
npm run android    # Run on Android
npm run ios        # Run on iOS
npm run lint       # Run ESLint

## Key Features

### Corrected Age Calculation
- Accounts for preterm birth in development tracking
- Automatically adjusts milestone expectations
- Used until 24 months corrected age

### Milestone Tracking
- Preterm-specific developmental milestones
- Categories: Motor, Cognitive, Social, Language
- Clinical notes and delay indicators
- Age-appropriate filtering

### Cross-Platform Design
- Consistent UI across iOS and Android
- Accessibility-compliant components
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Development Notes

### Corrected Age Logic
The app uses corrected age for preterm babies:
- **Corrected Age** = Chronological Age - (Due Date - Birth Date)
- Used for milestone tracking until 24 months
- Helps set appropriate developmental expectations

### Milestone Categories
- **Motor Skills**: Physical development milestones
- **Cognitive**: Learning and thinking skills
- **Social & Emotional**: Interaction and emotional development
- **Language**: Communication and speech development

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for corrected age calculations
- Integration tests for milestone filtering
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Cross-platform testing on iOS/Android

## Next Development Steps

1. **Baby Profile Creation** - User onboarding and profile setup
2. **Corrected Age Integration** - Connect calculations to UI
3. **Milestone Logging** - Allow parents to track achievements
4. **Data Persistence** - AsyncStorage for offline functionality
5. **Push Notifications** - Milestone reminders and updates

## Contributing

This app follows the Neo-Nest project requirements defined in:
- [Requirements](.kiro/specs/neo-nest-mvp/requirements.md)
- [Implementation Plan](.kiro/specs/neo-nest-mvp/tasks.md)
- [Mobile Development Plan](../MOBILE-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Metro bundler issues**: Clear cache with `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
- **iOS build errors**: Clean build folder and reinstall pods
- **Android build errors**: Clean gradle cache and rebuild

### Platform-Specific Setup
- **iOS**: Requires Xcode and iOS Simulator
- **Android**: Requires Android Studio and Android SDK
- **Windows**: Limited iOS development support

For detailed troubleshooting, see [bug-fixes.md](../bug-fixes.md).
