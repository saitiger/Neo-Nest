    content: `# Understanding Corrected Age: A Parent's Guide

Corrected age is one of the most important concepts for parents of preterm babies to understand. It helps you track your baby's development more accurately and reduces unnecessary worry about delayed milestones.

## What is Corrected Age?

Corrected age (also called adjusted age) is your baby's age based on their original due date, not their birth date. For example, if your baby was born 8 weeks early and is now 12 weeks old, their corrected age would be 4 weeks.

## Why is Corrected Age Important?

Preterm babies need extra time to catch up to their full-term peers. Using corrected age helps:
- Set realistic expectations for development
- Reduce anxiety about "delayed" milestones
- Communicate effectively with healthcare providers
- Make appropriate decisions about feeding, sleep, and activities

## How to Calculate Corrected Age

The formula is simple:
**Corrected Age = Chronological Age - Weeks Born Early**

Most healthcare providers use corrected age until your child is 2-3 years old, depending on how early they were born.

## When to Use Corrected Age

Use corrected age for:
- Developmental milestones
- Sleep expectations
- Feeding schedules
- Activity planning
- Medical appointments

Remember, every baby develops at their own pace, even when using corrected age. Trust your instincts and work closely with your healthcare team.`,

    content: `# Safe Sleep for Preterm Babies

Creating a safe sleep environment is crucial for all babies, but preterm babies may have additional considerations.

## Safe Sleep Basics

### Always place your baby:
- On their back to sleep
- On a firm sleep surface
- In a crib or bassinet free of soft bedding
- In your room (but not in your bed) for at least the first 6 months

## Special Considerations for Preterm Babies

### Temperature Regulation
Preterm babies may have difficulty regulating their body temperature. Consider:
- Room temperature between 68-70Â°F
- Appropriate sleepwear for the temperature
- Avoiding overheating

### Breathing Monitoring
Some preterm babies may come home with:
- Apnea monitors
- Pulse oximeters
- Special positioning devices (as recommended by your medical team)

### Sleep Patterns
Preterm babies may:
- Sleep more than full-term babies initially
- Have irregular sleep-wake cycles
- Take longer to develop day-night patterns

## When to Call Your Doctor

Contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
- Changes in breathing patterns
- Unusual color changes
- Difficulty waking for feeds
- Any concerns about your baby's sleep

Remember, safe sleep practices save lives. When in doubt, consult your healthcare team.`,

Tummy time is important for all babies, but preterm babies may need a modified approach based on their corrected age and individual development.

## Benefits of Tummy Time:
- Strengthens neck and shoulder muscles
- Prevents flat spots on the head
- Promotes motor development
- Encourages visual development

## Getting Started:
- Begin when your baby is alert and content
- Start with short sessions (1-2 minutes)
- Gradually increase duration as tolerated
- Always supervise tummy time

## Modifications for Preterm Babies:
- Use corrected age to determine readiness
- May need extra support initially
- Watch for signs of fatigue
- Consult with physical therapist if needed`,
