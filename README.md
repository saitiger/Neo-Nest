# Neo-Nest

A mobile-first app for parents of preterm babies from NICU discharge through the toddler stage, providing doctor-backed guidance, corrected age tracking, and community support.

## Project Status

Currently in **MVP Development Phase** - building user research validation page and collecting feedback from preterm parents.

## Quick Start

### MVP Home Page (User Research)
```bash
# Navigate to MVP directory and open in browser
cd MVP
# Double-click index.html or serve locally
```

**Important**: The JavaScript requires a browser environment. Do not run `script.js` directly with Node.js.
