# Neo-Nest

A mobile-first app for parents of preterm babies from NICU discharge through the toddler stage, providing doctor-backed guidance, corrected age tracking, and community support.

## Project Status

**Phase**: Phase 5 - Baby Profile System Development ðŸš§  
**Completed**: User research validation, React Native foundation, core utilities, milestone system, complete authentication system  
**Current**: Baby profile creation and corrected age integration  
**Next**: Milestone logging functionality and data persistence

### Development Progress
- âœ… **Phase 1**: User Research & Validation (2-4 weeks) - Complete
- âœ… **Phase 2**: React Native Foundation (1-2 weeks) - Complete  
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Core Utilities & Milestone System (1-2 weeks) - Complete
- âœ… **Phase 4**: Authentication System (2-3 weeks) - Complete
- ðŸš§ **Phase 5**: Baby Profile System - In Progress
- ðŸ“‹ **Phase 6-12**: Content library, community features, provider directory, premium features

### Major Achievements
- âœ… **Production-Ready Authentication**: Complete login, registration, password recovery with secure token management
- âœ… **Cross-Platform Architecture**: React Native 0.81.4 with TypeScript, iOS/Android compatibility
- âœ… **Corrected Age Engine**: Comprehensive calculation utilities with 100% test coverage
- âœ… **Milestone Foundation**: Preterm-specific milestone data and interactive tracking screens
- âœ… **Security Implementation**: Encrypted AsyncStorage, JWT tokens, form validation
- âœ… **Professional UI/UX**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant design with consistent branding

## Quick Start

### React Native Mobile App
```bash
# Navigate to React Native project
cd NeoNestApp
npm install

# Run on iOS (Mac only)
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android
```

### MVP Home Page (User Research - Completed)
```bash
# Navigate to MVP directory and open in browser
cd MVP
# Double-click index.html or serve locally
```

**Important**: The JavaScript requires a browser environment. Do not run `script.js` directly with Node.js.
