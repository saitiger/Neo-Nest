# Neo-Nest

A mobile-first app for parents of preterm babies from NICU discharge through the toddler stage, providing doctor-backed guidance, corrected age tracking, and community support.

## Project Status

**Phase**: Hybrid Mobile Development - Authentication Complete âœ…  
**Completed**: User research validation, React Native setup, corrected age utilities, milestone tracking, authentication system  
**Current**: Baby profile creation and corrected age integration  
**Next**: Milestone logging functionality and data persistence

### Development Progress
- âœ… **User Research**: Web prototype validation completed
- âœ… **React Native Setup**: TypeScript configuration and navigation structure
- âœ… **Core Utilities**: Corrected age calculation engine with comprehensive tests
- âœ… **Milestone System**: Preterm-specific milestone data and tracking screens
- âœ… **Cross-Platform UI**: Responsive design for iOS and Android
- âœ… **Authentication System**: Complete login, registration, and password recovery flow
- âœ… **User Management**: Secure data storage, JWT tokens, and session management
- ðŸš§ **Baby Profile Creation**: User onboarding and profile setup
- ðŸš§ **Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage integration for offline functionality

See [Implementation Plan](.kiro/specs/neo-nest-mvp/tasks.md) for detailed development roadmap.

## Quick Start

### React Native Mobile App
```bash
# Navigate to React Native project
cd NeoNestApp
npm install

# Run on iOS (Mac only)
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android
```

### MVP Home Page (User Research - Completed)
```bash
# Navigate to MVP directory and open in browser
cd MVP
# Double-click index.html or serve locally
```

**Important**: The JavaScript requires a browser environment. Do not run `script.js` directly with Node.js.

## Core Features (Planned)

- **Corrected Age Tracking**: Progress tracker understanding preterm development
- **Doctor-Backed Content**: Clinician-reviewed articles and milestones  
- **Moderated Community**: Safe peer support with expert oversight
- **Activity Library**: Age-appropriate play suggestions
- **Provider Directory**: Specialized healthcare provider listings

## Target Users

- New NICU-discharge parents (25-40, first-time or multiples)
- Parents of preterm toddlers (28-42, returning to work)
- Healthcare experts (pediatricians, neonatologists, therapists)

## Development Approach

- **Platform**: Hybrid Mobile (React Native/Flutter) for cross-platform MVP
- **Current Phase**: User research validation via web prototype
- **Next Phase**: Hybrid mobile app development with validated features
