## Quick Start

### Interactive Web Preview (Instant Demo)
```bash
# Navigate to React Native project and open web preview
cd NeoNestApp
# Double-click web-preview.html or open in browser
open web-preview.html
```

The web preview provides an interactive demonstration of the complete Neo-Nest app including:
- Baby profile management with corrected age calculations
- Milestone tracking with progress indicators and categories
- Community forum with expert posts and moderated discussions
- Complete navigation between all main app screens

### React Native Mobile App
```bash
# Navigate to React Native project
cd NeoNestApp
npm install

# Run on iOS (Mac only)
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android
```

### MVP Home Page (User Research - Completed)
```bash
# Navigate to MVP directory and open in browser
cd MVP
# Double-click index.html or serve locally
```

**Important**: The JavaScript requires a browser environment. Do not run `script.js` directly with Node.js.
